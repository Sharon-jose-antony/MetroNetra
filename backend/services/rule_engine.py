MetroNetra — Deterministic Legal Metrology Rule Engine
Evaluates extracted declarations against the official rules catalog.

Design:
- Rules are loaded from rules/legal_metrology_rules.json at startup.
- Applicability is product-category-aware.
- OCR failure != legal violation.
- Insufficient evidence routes to MANUAL_REVIEW, not POTENTIAL_NON_COMPLIANCE.
