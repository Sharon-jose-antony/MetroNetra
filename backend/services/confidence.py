MetroNetra — Prototype Confidence Scoring Service
Computes a multi-signal weighted confidence score from pipeline components.

IMPORTANT:
- This is labeled "Prototype Confidence Score" — it is NOT statistically calibrated.
- It does NOT represent probability of legal violation.
- It is a weighted agreement score across OCR, extraction, image quality, and applicability signals.
