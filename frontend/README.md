## 🛠 Running the Frontend

### Option 1: Served Automatically by FastAPI Backend (Recommended)
When the FastAPI backend is running, the frontend is served directly at the root URL:
```
http://localhost:8000/
```
No separate frontend server is required in this mode.

### Option 2: Standalone Static Server (Node.js)
If you wish to serve the frontend separately (e.g. on port 3000):

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

2. In the inspector dashboard, click the **Local Network IP** badge at the bottom of the sidebar.
3. Open the displayed URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.X:8000`) in your mobile browser.
4. Tap **📸 Capture Product** — your phone's native camera will open automatically.
